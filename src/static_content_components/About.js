      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The Forecast Model is part of the larger ACCESS (Access to Childhood Cancer Essentials) initiative, which strives to create and implement innovative solutions to childhood cancer drug and radiotherapy access in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

      <h2>Model feedback</h2>	
      <p>The goal of the Forecast Model is to be as user-friendly, pragmatic, and impactful as possible. We strive to help users organize their data, while filling in the blanks with the best publicly available sources where there are gaps. Our included regimens draw on international expert recommendations for resource-adapted care and seek to be as reflective of real-world use as possible.</p>
