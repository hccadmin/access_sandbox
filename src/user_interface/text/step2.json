To ensure model results were consistent with epidemiological data, the model is calibrated to publicly available cancer registry data using a Bayesian approach in which the observed data are fixed and the model parameters (cancer incidence and probabilities of health system access and referral) are random variables. The microsimulation estimated total incidence of childhood cancer (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in each country in 2015 and then projected the number of cases from 2015 to 2030."
