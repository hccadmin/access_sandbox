Selection of high-income countries or regions will generate baseline estimates of demand and cost, which may not reflect the full extent of treatment regimens used in high-income settings. More comprehensive incorporation of treatment regimens corresponding to level 4 care is planned for future updates of the Model to enhance the accuracy and applicability of these estimates to high-income centers and jurisdictions."
