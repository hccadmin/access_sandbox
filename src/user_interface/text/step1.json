To estimate what percent of institutions fall into Level 1, 2 and 3 within your geography, please read the definition of each level by clicking the link above and estimating the percent of institutions in your geography that fall into each. To adjust percentages, click the \"Custom\" button below and fill in the percentage for each Level (numbers must add up to 100)."
